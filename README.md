# Firehose

This repository is an attempt to show that the there are always at
least n ways to deal with a problem. Doing a few implementations
and measuring never hurt nobody.

This repo will build it all from source then reduce it to one linear
init process. 

## TODO:
- Earthly
- terraform docker provider
- systemd init to linearize ;) 

## Data

## Logs
EFK

## Metrics
Prometheus

## CNI
Cilium seem neat. Very interested in the static verification.
